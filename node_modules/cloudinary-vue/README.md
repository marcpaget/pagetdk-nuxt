            <cld-transformation crop="scale" width="200" angle="10" />
          </cld-image>
        </cld-context>
    ```

    <cld-context cloudName="demo">
       <cld-image cloudName="demo" publicId="sample">
          <cld-transformation angle="-45" />
          <cld-transformation effect="trim" angle="45" crop="scale" width="600" />
